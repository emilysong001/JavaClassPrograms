    /*what is IF Statement?
    IF statement is a flow controlling statement in programming
this is the statement that helps us execute a specific part of the code only when our program meets certain conditions.
    conditions are defined in a booleanExpression which could be taken from comparing 2 numbers, comparing Strings etc.
    If statements have a body which are scoped via {} when the boolean is false the code skips everything inside the if statements body { } and the program will proceed executing everyhing after the body.
    ex:
            if(hourOfDay<11) {
        print("good morning")
    }
    When there are multiple use cases, multiple scenarios for the logic you can pair if statements with else if and else statements
else if statements is a great way to handle multiple scenarios in the most efficient way for perfamce, bc as soon as the program finds the first true if statement it will execute the body that if and skip the ramaining else ifs that way the program doesnt waste time to compare all else if conditions.
